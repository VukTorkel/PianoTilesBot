# PianoTilesBot
my approach to automate piano tiles ( magic tiles 3 )

NOT FINISHED OR RLY WORKING ATM

TODO:
* make it so it only triggers once every block (maybe by using the whiter border)
* multithread, one thread for each line would probably be easier
* tap and hold sections, maybe ignore and just tap once like every other block
